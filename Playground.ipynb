I would like to work more in DS or be able to pivot into engineering. My undergrad was not directly in computer science but I did have significant exposure to AI/ML before LLMs and generative models were mainstream. I don’t have any work experience directly in ML or DS, but my analyst roles over the last few years have been SQL-oriented with some scripting here and there.\n",

I also just generally miss learning and am open to a career pivot, and also have always wanted to try working on research projects (never did it for my MS). I’m leaning towards no and instead just working on relevant certifications, but I want to pivot out of Business Operations or business intelligence roles into more technical teams such as ML teams or product. Internal migration within my own company does not seem possible at the moment. ...\n",

We want it to be the most usable RAG builder, while also offering powerful options for finding the ideal RAG parameters.\n",

      "\n",
      "* **Easy to get started**: just drop in documents, select a template configuration, and you're up and running in a few minutes.\n",
      "* **Highly customizable**: you can customize the document extractor, chunking strategy, embedding model/dimension, and search index (vector/full-text/hybrid). Start simple with one-click templates, but go as deep as you want on tuning/customization.\n",
      "* **Document library**: manage documents, tag document sets, preview extractions, sync across your team, and more.\n",
      "* **Deep integrations**: evaluate RAG-task performance with our evals, expose RAG as a tool to any tool-compatible model\n",
      "* **Local**: the Kiln app runs locally and we can't access your data. The V1 of RAG requires API keys for extraction/embeddings, but we're working on fully-local RAG as we speak; see below for questions about where we should focus.\n",

      "**Question for you:** V1 has a decent number of options for tuning, but folks are probably going to want more. We’d love suggestions for where to expand first. Options are:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Document extraction**: V1 focuses on model-based extractors (Gemini/GPT) as they outperformed library-based extractors (docling, markitdown) in our tests. Which additional models/libraries/configs/APIs would you want? Specific open models? Marker? Docling?\n",
      "* **Embedding Models**: We're looking at EmbeddingGemma & Qwen Embedding as open/local options. Any other embedding models people like for RAG?\n",
      "* **Chunking**: V1 uses the sentence splitter from llama\\_index. Do folks have preferred semantic chunkers or other chunking strategies?\n",
      "* **Vector database**: V1 uses LanceDB for vector, full-text (BM25), and hybrid search. Should we support more? Would folks want Qdrant? Chroma? Weaviate? pg-vector? HNSW tuning parameters?\n",
      "* Anything else?\n",
